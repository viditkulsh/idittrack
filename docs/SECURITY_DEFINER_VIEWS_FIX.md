# Security Definer Views Fix

## Issue
Your database linter detected that the following views were created with the `SECURITY DEFINER` property:
- `public.orders_summary`
- `public.dashboard_stats` 
- `public.inventory_summary`

## Problem with SECURITY DEFINER
Views with `SECURITY DEFINER` enforce the permissions of the view creator rather than the querying user. This can be a security risk because:

1. **Privilege Escalation**: Users might access data they shouldn't be able to see
2. **Security Bypass**: Row Level Security (RLS) policies might be bypassed
3. **Audit Trail Issues**: Actions appear to come from the view creator, not the actual user

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed View Definitions
Updated all view creation statements to use `security_invoker = true`:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW public.inventory_summary 
WITH (security_invoker = true)
AS
-- ... view definition
```

This ensures views run with the permissions of the querying user, not the creator.

### 2. Added Proper RLS Policies
Created Row Level Security policies for each view:

- **inventory_summary**: All authenticated users can view
- **orders_summary**: Users see their own orders, admin/manager see all
- **dashboard_stats**: Admin and manager roles only

### 3. Files Updated
- `fix-security-definer-views.sql` - Script to fix existing database
- `complete-database-setup.sql` - Updated for future deployments
- `database/FRESH_START_SIMPLE_SCHEMA.sql` - Updated for fresh installs

## How to Apply the Fix

### For Existing Database
Run the fix script in your Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Execute the contents of fix-security-definer-views.sql
```

### For New Deployments
The updated database setup files will now create views correctly from the start.

## Verification
After applying the fix, the database linter should no longer report security definer view warnings.

## Security Benefits
1. ✅ Views now respect user permissions
2. ✅ RLS policies are properly enforced
3. ✅ No privilege escalation vulnerabilities
4. ✅ Proper audit trail maintained
5. ✅ Follows PostgreSQL security best practices

## Access Control Summary
- **Regular Users**: Can view inventory, their own orders only
- **Managers**: Can view inventory, all orders, dashboard stats
- **Admins**: Can view inventory, all orders, dashboard stats

This approach maintains functionality while improving security posture.
